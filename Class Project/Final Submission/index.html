        <p>I made this website in order to bring updated information about activities among other things for computer science.</p>

        <p>I hope that I can at least bring some attention to this subject.</p>
         
         <p>I would like people to know that there will be an extra class that will give some extra useful information for people who would like the extra knowledge happening in this specific area</p>

         <h2>News</h2>
         
         <p>There will some events that would be good for people who would like to 
         have some more time with subjects relating to computer science later this 
         week in the library. There will also be some more news that will be told next week.</p>
